I am a beginner software development student at WeThinkCode_, passionate about learning the fundamentals of programming and software development. I'm currently diving into various programming languages, understanding algorithms, and exploring the basics of software engineering. My goal is to build a strong foundation that will provide software solutions. I'm excited to collaborate with other people, take on coding challenges, and improve my skills in this field of different languages.
